Init. 
Lpcexpresso 1114 platform.
The target is standalone LPC1114 DIP28.
This init is based on Code Red SSP (SPI) example.
Compilable, not tested.

SPITESTS_LoopbackHardwareISPTest() tests passed.
Up to buffer size = 256 bytes. Not tested for longer buffer
because buffer is byte type and source cells can be init on byte - up to 256.
Not working for buffer length not rounded to 8 bytes !
This is probably because ISR Rx is called when half of FIFO is received - 4 bytes.
How to solve it ?
