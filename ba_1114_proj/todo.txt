1. 
Finish with main.c and spi_tests.c

(140103)
SPITESTS_LoopbackHardwareISPTest() tests passed.
Up to buffer size = 256 bytes. Not tested for longer buffer
because buffer is byte type and source cells can be init on byte - up to 256.
Not working for buffer length not rounded to 8 bytes !
This is probably because ISR Rx is called when half of FIFO is received - 4 bytes.
How to solve it ?



2.
If tests above are working,

Compare lpcopen and ST32 drivers design and tests

Modify spi init functions to put parameters to the function.
Repeat tests.


3.
Now make a tag, and try to connect baro sensor in sensor branch


4.
Seems to be mess with type.h and stdint.h from GNU.
Some drivers use one, some other.
